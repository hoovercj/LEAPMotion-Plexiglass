# LEAPMotion-Plexiglass

This app is built on the [Processing](https://processing.org/) platform and utilizes a [LEAP Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) and combined with a piece of plexiglass to demonstrate a mixed virtual/physical interaction scheme.

This was designed and built as a solo project for HCI 580: Virtual Environments at Iowa State University.

You can see the project in action on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilZaEZKzXH0).
